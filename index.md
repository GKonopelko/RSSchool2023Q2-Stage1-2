## Reflections

I really liked TypeScript. I was really inspired by its purpose and idea. I completed the first three modules happily and did not understand why some people consider TypeScript difficult. And then I realized... I still have very little understanding of classes in JavaScript. Adding typing to classes further complicates the whole code and does not make it easier for me to implement. I came to a conclusion: I need more practice. In theory, everything is clear.
